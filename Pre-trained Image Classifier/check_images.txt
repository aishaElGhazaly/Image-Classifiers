4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
For this particular set of uploaded images resnet is the best model. All models have almost identical stats where they correctly classify the dogs & their breed and the penguin while misclassifying the headphones. Although alexnet is the fastest model(0:0:1), it misclassified the headphones as a backpack while resnet -which is the second fastest model(0:0:4)- misclassified it as a loudspeaker, which is -while wrong- much more accurate. Resnet provided the required balance between accuracy and speed.
